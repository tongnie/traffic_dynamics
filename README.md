# [Update Dec]
- We have uploaded a series of detailed notebook to demonstrate different applications of the model "ST-INR" described in our paper. These notebooks are used to reproduce main experiments in our paper.
- **Our ST-INR paper has been accepted for publication in an upcoming issue of Transportation Research Part C! After a careful preparation, the model implementation as well as experiments will be uploaded soon.**
