# [Update Dec]
- We begin the process of sharing the code to reproduce our work. We have uploaded a detailed notebook to demonstrate the first task -- traffic state estimation. More guidelines will be updated gradually this week!
- **Our ST-INR paper has been accepted for publication in an upcoming issue of Transportation Research Part C! After a careful preparation, the model implementation as well as experiments will be uploaded soon.**
- We release a toy example using the Low-Rank Tensor Functional Representation for modeling 3-dimensional traffic flow data.
